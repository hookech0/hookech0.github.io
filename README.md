This is a work in progress but I am hoping to provide some interesting write-ups on CTFs, certficate and course feedback, CVEs, and anything related to offsec.

I've been a pentester for several years and my main area of focus is on Active Directory, but I am interested in really everything, that's just what I am most comfortable with. I hope to expand some of my knowledge and share anything learned along the way back to the community.
